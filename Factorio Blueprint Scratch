Phase 0:

Startpoint at spaceship assemblers. This is grid 1, coord 0.
Problem discription:
- Need to locate a place to place Brain
    - Needs to be not on resources or water
    - Needs to have correct coordiant and grid number set
- Need to constuct all basic stuctures while no proper resource transportaion exists
    - Option one: Logisic bots
        - Pros:
            - Already have infrastructure in place
            - Simple to implement
        - Cons:
            - Don't want to use logistic bots
            - Need to do the same search for resouces and 75% of the block assignment anyway
    - Option two: Build a Phase 0 belt setup that will be removed for the phase one setup.
        - Pros:
            - Can use already existing mining belt blocks with some adjustments
        - Cons:
            - Need to be removed for the Phase 1 Belt Grid... though all Phase 0 grids will likely have to be removed


Phase Zero Logistic Bots:
    - Place Block 1 - Spaceship assemblers to make circuit 1
    -
